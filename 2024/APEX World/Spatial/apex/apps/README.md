# Sample App to demo Custom Map Backgrounds in APEX 23.2

The APEX app can be imported into any APEX 23.2 workspace.

The data used as layers on the Map Backgrounds can be installed with the [Sample Map Application](https://github.com/oracle/apex/tree/23.2/sample-apps/sample-maps).

The random point data set for the Netherlands used with Vector Tile Layers is generated using [this SQL script](./create_sample_point_data.sql) you need to run in APEX SQL Workshop.

The usage of DATAVIZ Vector Tiles is free with Oracle APEX or [Oracle Spatial Studio](https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/spatial-studio/get-started.html).
