# Sample App to demo Custom Map Backgrounds in APEX 23.2

The APEX app can be imported into any APEX 23.2 workspace.

The data used as layers on the Map Backgrounds can be installed with the [Sample Map Application](https://github.com/oracle/apex/tree/23.2/sample-apps/sample-maps).

The usage of DATAVIZ Vector Tiles is free with Oracle APEX or [Oracle Spatial Studio](https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/spatial-studio/get-started.html).

The creation and deletion of the random point data set for the Netherlands, that is displayed on Vector Tile Layers, is done via supporting objects during the application installation rsp. de-installation. Therefore, you do not need to run the two SQL scripts, contained in this folder, separately.
